# iOS-ARKit

***This repository contains the code for making an AR Portal using ARKit. This portal uses the concept of CubeMap for showing the scene inside the portal. A cubemap is a image divided into cubes of equal sizes. Each cube corresponds to +x,+y,+z,-x,-y,-z directions w.r.t world origin. These are used to cover the walls of the Portl from inside that gives a look of entering another dimension.***

# Requirements

* XCode 9

* iPhone [6/6S,7/7+/7 SE,8/8+, X]

* Apple Developer Account


# Usage

1. Clone this repository.

2. Go inside the AR-Portal folder and execute the xcodeprojext file.

3. This should build the code and install the app onto your phone.

4. Launch the app till you get the world origin.

5. Once you get the World Origin, focus the camera onto a Horizontal surface as that is the surface on which our AR Portal will be Augmented.

6. Once the app displays "Plane Detected", tap on the screen and 'voila', the AR-Portal is in front of you.

Here's a quick demo of how this app works:
